# Media Files Cleanup Summary

## What Was Removed:

### 1. Settings Configuration
- **MEDIA_URL** and **MEDIA_ROOT** settings
- Commented out Cloudinary configuration
- Custom media files middleware reference

### 2. URL Configuration
- Media file serving URLs (`static(settings.MEDIA_URL, ...)`)
- Static file serving URLs (no longer needed with WhiteNoise)
- Import statements for media URL handling

### 3. Custom Middleware
- **coreflowepc/middleware.py** - Custom MediaFilesMiddleware class
- Middleware entry from MIDDLEWARE list in settings

### 4. Directory Structure
- **media/** directory and all its contents
- **test_image_path.py** - Test script file

## What Remains (Static File System):

### 1. Static File Configuration
```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

# WhiteNoise configuration for serving static files with DEBUG=False
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
WHITENOISE_USE_FINDERS = True
WHITENOISE_AUTOREFRESH = True
```

### 2. Custom Storage System
- **casestudy/storage.py** - StaticImageStorage class
- **casestudy/models.py** - Updated to use StaticImageStorage
- Upload path function saves to static directory

### 3. Template Updates
- Templates use `{% static casestudy.casestudyimage.name %}` instead of `{{ casestudy.casestudyimage.url }}`
- Both index.html and casestudy_detail.html updated

## Benefits of Cleanup:

1. **Simplified Configuration**: No more media/static file confusion
2. **Heroku Compatibility**: All uploaded images persist as static files
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Single file storage system (static files only)
4. **Better Performance**: WhiteNoise handles all file serving efficiently
5. **No External Dependencies**: No need for Cloudinary or other services

## Next Steps:

1. **Test locally**: Ensure image uploads work correctly
2. **Deploy to Heroku**: Verify images persist across deployments
3. **Re-upload images**: Upload case study images through admin interface
4. **Monitor performance**: Check that static file serving is working optimally

All media file configurations have been successfully removed and replaced with a static file-based system that works seamlessly with Heroku's ephemeral filesystem.
