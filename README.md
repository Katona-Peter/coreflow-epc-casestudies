### Prioritization of User Stories

To ensure that the most valuable features were delivered first, the MoSCoW prioritization method was applied to all user stories:

- **Must have**: Essential features required for the application to function (e.g., case study display, user authentication, admin interface).
- **Should have**: Important but not vital features that add significant value (e.g., comment approval workflow, image upload system, responsive design).
- **Could have**: Desirable features that enhance user experience but are not critical (e.g., advanced search/filtering, parallax effects, icon integration).
- **Won't have (this time)**: Features considered out of scope for the current release but may be included in future updates (e.g., PDF export, multi-language support).

By categorizing user stories using MoSCoW, the team was able to focus on delivering core functionality first, while still planning for enhancements and future growth. This approach ensured that the project met essential requirements and provided a clear roadmap for iterative development.

## Testing

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

This project implements a multi-layered testing approach to ensure code quality, accessibility, performance, and functionality across all components. Our testing methodology combines automated tools with manual testing procedures to deliver a robust and reliable web application.

#### HTML Validation with W3C Markup Validator

**Tool**: [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

**Pure HTML vs. Django Template Language (DTL) Validation**

It's crucial to understand the fundamental difference between validating pure HTML and Django Template Language (DTL) files:

- **Pure HTML Validation**: Tests the final rendered HTML output that browsers receive
  - Method: Copy rendered page source from browser or use direct URL validation
  - Validates: Actual HTML structure, proper nesting, valid attributes
  - Best Practice: Test the live application URLs for final output validation

- **DTL Template Validation**: Cannot be directly validated as raw template files contain Django syntax
  - DTL files contain: `{% extends %}`, `{{ variables }}`, `{% for %}` loops, `{% if %}` statements
  - W3C Validator Error: Raw DTL files will show errors due to Django template syntax
  - Solution: Always validate the rendered output, not the template source files

**Testing Process**:
1. **Live URL Validation**: Direct validation of deployed application pages
2. **Source Code Validation**: Copy-paste rendered HTML from browser view-source
3. **Batch Validation**: Test multiple pages systematically for comprehensive coverage

**Screenshots**: Validation results will be documented with screenshots stored in `staticfiles/images/testing/w3c-validation/`
